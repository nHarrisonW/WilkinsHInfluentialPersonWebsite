            <p>Despite being a star athlete in high school, being the son of an NBA player, and being named All-Conference and All-State, Stephen Curry was not a highly sought-after player. Rated at only a three-star recruit, he did not recieve offers from the best basketball schools, such as Duke, or Kansas. Instead, he went to Davidson College in North Carolina. </p>
            <p>People doubted that Curry would be able to play against the top talent in the NBA due to his size. Still, he became Davidson's all-time leading scorer in just three-years, and lead the underdog team all the way to the Elite Eight of March Madness before being knocked out of the tournament.</p>
            <p>This skyrocketed Curry's draft value, and in less than a month, went from a player that may not be drafted at all, to having every NBA team with their eyes on Him.</p>

            <p>At the seventh pick in the 2009 NBA Draft, the Golden State Warriors select Stephen Curry. Many people are surprised Curry was not the first pick of the draft, but he was not always the best player on the floor.</p>
            <p>Blake Griffin, Hasheem Thabeet, James Harden, Tyreke Evans, Ricky Rubio, and Johny Flynn were all selected before Stephen Curry, and in a few years, they would be kicking themsleves for their decision. </p>
