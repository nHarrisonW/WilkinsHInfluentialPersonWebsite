            <p>Curry's rookie season, he flew under the radar, missing the Rookie of the Year award, and not initially making as much noise as other players in his draft class, such as Blake Griffin and James Harden. This wouldn't last long however, as rumors began to fly around. </p>
            <p>The warriors were ready to move on from their starting point guard, and on March 13, 2012 the move was finally made. Monta Ellis was traded to the Bucks for Stephen Jackson and Andrew Bogut, who ended up being an imperative piece to their 2015 Championship run.</p>
            <p>Curry was in finally in position to take control of the team, and that's exactly what coach Mark Jackson let him do. This was while a younger guard by the name of Klay Thompson was developing a promising game.</p>

            <p>In 2013, the "Splash Brothers" broke the record for the most three pointers in a season, and have broken that record man times over at this point.</p>
            <p>This pointed to a trend of three-pointers that has only ramped up since 2013. That's what makes Curry's career so important, and so impressive. Not only did he fight the uphill battle in a league that didn't think he could last, but he excelled and changed the way that basketball is played today. Before Curry, no centers shot three-pointers, but now it is very important that all players are on the floor are able to shoot from deep. </p>
